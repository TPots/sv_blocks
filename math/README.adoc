== uadd

Takes in two `n` bit signals (`in0` and `in1`), and signals the sum of `in0` and `in1` on `out`.

If `out` is unable to encode the sum of `in0` and `in1` and would overflows,`out` is pulled high, `sig_ov` is pulled high, and `overflow` carries the magnitude `out` was overflowed by.

=== Parameters

- `DATA_WIDTH`: Input parameter setting the width of the signals `in0`,in1`,out`, and `overflow`. `DATA_WIDTH` has no value by default.

=== Inputs

[cols="25%,75%"]

| Name
| `in0`

| Size
| `DATA_WIDTH` as `[DATA_WIDTH - 1 : 0]`

| Encoding
| Unsigned Integer

| Description
| A signal carrying the first term of the sum.

| `out`

| Size
| `DATA_WIDTH` as `[DATA_WIDTH - 1 : 0]`

| Encoding

| Description
| A signal carrying the sum of `in0` and `in1`. If `out` cannot encode the sum of `in0` and `in1` `out` is pulled high.

| `overflow`

| Size
| `DATA_WIDTH` as `[DATA_WIDTH - 1 : 0]`

| Encoding
| Unsigned Integer

| Description
| A signal carrying the magnitude that `out` would overflow if the sum of `in0` and `in1` cannot be encoded by `out`. If `out` is capable of encoding the sum of `in0` and `in1`, `overflow' is pulled low.

| Name
| `sig_ov`

| Size
| `1`

| Encoding
| Boolean

| Description
| A signal carrying the overflow condition of `out`. `sig_ov` is pulled high if `out` is overflowed by the sum of `in0` and `in1` and otherwise is pulled low.
|===

== umul

Takes in two `n` bit signals (`in0` and `in1`), and outputs the product on the signal `out`.

If `out` is unable to encode the product of `in0`, and `in1` it is pulled high and the overflow is singaled on the output `sig_of`.

==== Parameters

- `DATA_WIDTH`: Input parameter setting the width of the signals `in0`,in1`,out`, and `overflow`. `DATA_WIDTH` has no value by default.

| Encoding
| Boolean

| Description
| | A signal carrying the overflow condition of `out`. `sig_ov` is pulled high if `out` is overflowed by the product of `in0` and `in1` and otherwise is pulled low.

== usub

Takes in two signals (`in0` and `in1`), and signals the differenece of `in0` and `in1` on `out`.

If `out` is unable to encode the difference of `in0` and `in1` and would result in underflow, `out` is pulled low, `sig_ov` is pulled high, and `underflow` carries the magnitude `out` was underflowed by.

=== Parameters

- `DATA_WIDTH`: Input parameter setting the width of the signals `in0`,in1`,out`, and `underflow`. `DATA_WIDTH` has no value by default.
